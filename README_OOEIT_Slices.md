## Getting started
There are two drivers and a folder that stores the slices. 

1. The first one 'Driver_make_slices_for_OOEIT' makes the slices and requires DistMesh. Install it at

https://github.com/ionhandshaker/distmesh/

and add the path to the driver:

'add path distmesh-master/' where DistMesh is located. 

2. The slices are then saved in the 'Slices_folder'.


3. The second driver 'Driver_run_OOEIT_with_slices' runs the forward problem and finds the slices closest to the measurement. To run the code, you will need to download OOEIT

https://github.com/PetriKuusela/OOEIT/

and add the path to the driver.
